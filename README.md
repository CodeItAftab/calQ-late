# calQ-late
Description:

The Basic CalQ-late App is a simple yet powerful web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations and explore trigonometric functions with their inverses. This project was created as a fun and educational way to deepen my understanding of web development and JavaScript programming.

Key Features:

Arithmetic Operations: Users can easily add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers using the intuitive interface of the calculator.
Trigonometric Functions: The calculator provides access to the sine, cosine, and tangent of an angle, allowing users to perform common trigonometric calculations with ease.
Inverse Trigonometric Functions: Users can also calculate the inverse sine, inverse cosine, and inverse tangent, making it a versatile tool for various mathematical applications.
Logarithmic Calculation: The calculator supports log calculations, enabling users to find the logarithm of a given number.
User-Friendly Interface: The app's user interface is designed to be straightforward and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
How to Use:

Open the app in your web browser.
Enter numerical values and click on the respective arithmetic operator or function button.
The result will be displayed in real-time.
Motivation:
As an aspiring web developer, I wanted to challenge myself by building a functional calculator that goes beyond basic arithmetic. I aimed to enhance my knowledge of JavaScript and its math-related functions while creating a practical tool that could be useful for everyday calculations.

Future Enhancements:
I plan to continue working on this project and implement additional features, such as scientific functions, memory storage for calculations, and support for more advanced mathematical expressions. Feedback and contributions from the open-source community are highly welcome!

Contribution:
Feel free to fork this repository, explore the code, and contribute to its development. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or reach out to me directly.

Let's make math more accessible and fun with this Basic Calculator App!
